          <h2>Hi! I’m Nathan Green</h2>
          <article>
            I’m a former software salesperson and aspiring full-stack developer with a passion for building web
            applications that solve real-world problems. My journey into development stems from my professional
            background, love for problem-solving, and curiosity about how technology shapes our lives.

          <h3>From Sales to Software Development</h3>
          <p>
            For years, I worked in software sales, acting as the bridge between clients and development teams. This role
            gave me insight into the software development lifecycle and taught me how to identify and communicate client
            needs effectively. While I enjoyed helping customers find solutions, I became increasingly curious about how
            the software I sold was built. I wanted to be the one creating the tools that make people’s lives easier,
            which led me to pursue full-stack development.
          </p>
          <p>
            This transition has been both challenging and rewarding. Sales honed my communication and collaboration
            skills—qualities that now help me as a developer when working in teams or interpreting project requirements.
            My background also instilled a user-focused mindset that I bring to every project I tackle.

          <h3>Why Full-Stack Development?</h3>
          <p>
            What excites me about full-stack development is the ability to work on both the front and back ends of an
            application. I enjoy designing intuitive user interfaces that look great and function seamlessly while
            ensuring that the backend systems are robust, scalable, and efficient. This holistic approach to development
            is deeply satisfying, allowing me to see projects through from start to finish.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m driven by the opportunity to solve real-world problems through technology. Whether it’s streamlining
            workflows, creating new tools, or enhancing user experiences, I thrive on finding creative, impactful
            solutions.

          <h3>Interests and Inspirations</h3>
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I’m an avid skier. The thrill of tackling challenging slopes, coupled with the serenity
            of the mountains, is something I deeply cherish. Skiing has taught me persistence, adaptability, and
            focus—qualities that directly translate to coding and problem-solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m also passionate about lifelong learning. Transitioning from software sales to development has been a
            continuous journey of discovery. Each project, bug fix, and new concept reinforces my love for technology
            and the joy of mastering new skills.

          <h3>My Vision as a Developer</h3>
          <p>
            As an aspiring full-stack developer, I aim to build applications that are functional, accessible, and
            impactful. Great software isn’t just about solving problems; it’s about crafting user experiences that are
            meaningful and enjoyable. To achieve this, I prioritize empathy, staying current with industry trends, and
            adhering to core development principles.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Projects and Goals</h3>
          <p>
            While I’m early in my development journey, I’ve already built several projects, including web applications
            that enhance user experiences and tools powered by APIs. Each project has taught me new skills, from
            mastering JavaScript frameworks like React to building responsive designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the future, I want to contribute to open-source projects, tackle more complex applications, and explore
            emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain. These goals align with my passion for
            pushing boundaries and continuous learning.
